# Boost Documentation Tool Guide

This will eventually be a guide to using the boost documentation toolset. It
should act as a complement to the quickbook and boostbook documentation,
which will still be the definitive reference.

It's written using quickbook 1.6, so a recent build of quickbook is required.
